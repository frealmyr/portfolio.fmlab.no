# Simple-Portfolio
A simple portfolio website, designed to be minimalistic and compatible with both desktops and mobile devices.

Features include a simple image gallery and a image viewer with EXIF information. 

Comes with a docker-compose file for simple innstallation on Linux hosts. To start the server, simply run:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

The docker image is configured to be used with Traefik for reverse proxy. For a simple setup of Traefik visit my repository [traefik-host](https://github.com/frealmyr/traefik-host).
